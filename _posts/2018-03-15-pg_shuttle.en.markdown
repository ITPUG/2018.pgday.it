<h6>PG_Shuttle: the "express" for PGDay.IT 2018</ h6>

Aware that Lazise was a "risky" choice as the headquarters of the PGDay.IT, before confirming our selection, we verified the possibility of organizing a pick-up to make it easy to participate in the PGDay.IT 2018 for all interested parties.

And so "PG_Shuttle" is born!

Benefit from it is very simple and the service is free. Reserved only for PGDay.IT participants, the only thing required is to fill in the appropriate form.

The required data, in addition to the name and surname, are the place and time of arrival.

These are the days and time slots covered by the "PG_Shuttle" to reach the headquarters of the PGDay.IT 2018:

* June 28th from 17.00 to 21.00
* June 29th from 07.00 to 10.00

It will also be possible to use the service at the closing of the event, provided that you have made the booking. From about 18.00, "PG_Shuttle" will wait for you outside the PGDay.IT 2018 headquarters to bring you back to your destination: Verona Airport, Verona Station and Orio del Serio Airport.

For those who are accompanied by their families, a minimum contribution of â‚¬ 5.00 is requested for each accompanying person not enrolled in PGDay.IT 2018.
